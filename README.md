# About Me 
## I am an Astrophysics graduate currently using Machine learning to explore real-life datasets
I am a passionate aspiring data scientist who has broad and in-depth programming, statistics, mathematics, engineering and physics skills and I am using these skills to solve various real-life problems by using machine learning, data scrapping, and other types of data analytics and data visualization tools such as Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Tableau, etc. I have more than 3 years of experience in data analytics and predictive modeling.

I studied my masters at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium) in Astronomy and Astrophysics where I used various predictive modeling techniques to predict evolution of the most massive stars in our universe. I developed models and ran simulations to test the impact of various parameters most important being : new_mass_loss_rates and found that very massive stars encounter problems during the later part of their evolution. Additionally, the associated physics resulting from these simulations also allows for the formation of high mass black holes. The results are currently in the process of being published in a scientific journal. Following my pursuit to know more about the universe led me to work
with a lot of data that directed me to develop an interest in programming and exploring data science. During my Masters, I worked with different mathematical models and large volume datasets from telescopes around the world. 

## The current repository contains some of the data science projects that I have been working on. 
The work largely comprises of :
1. Machine Learning
2. Artificial Neural Networks
3. Structured Query Language (SQL)
4. Exploratory data analysis using Seaborn
